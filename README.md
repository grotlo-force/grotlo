# Grotlo

Grotlo is a set of libraries which provide basic building blocks for building distributed applications using 
Distributed Saga protocol. This work is heavily inspired by 
[Distributed Saga paper](https://github.com/aphyr/dist-sagas/blob/master/sagas.pdf) and corresponding talks done by McCaffrey Caitie, 
Kingsbury Kyle and Narula Neha.
